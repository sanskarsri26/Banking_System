The provided Java code constitutes a basic banking system application with two main classes: BankDetails and BankingApp. The BankDetails class encapsulates the attributes of a bank account, including account number, account holder name, account type, and balance. It offers methods for opening a new account, displaying account details, depositing money, withdrawing money, and searching for an account number. The BankingApp class serves as the main entry point, allowing users to interact with the banking system through a console-based menu. Users can input the number of initial customer accounts, create accounts, and perform operations such as displaying all account details, searching by account number, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The application runs in a loop until the user chooses the exit option. Overall, the code presents a straightforward implementation of a console-based banking system, demonstrating basic object-oriented programming concepts and user interaction in Java.
